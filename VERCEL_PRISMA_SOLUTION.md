# Vercel Deployment - Prisma Fix

## The Problem
Vercel has persistent permission issues with Prisma binaries during deployment, causing exit code 126 errors.

## The Solution
We've implemented a workaround that doesn't require Prisma generation during build:

### 1. Removed Prisma from Build Process
- Build script now only runs `next build` (no Prisma generation)
- Prisma generation happens in `postinstall` with graceful failure (`|| true`)

### 2. Created Shared Prisma Client
- Created `lib/prisma.ts` with a singleton Prisma client
- All API routes now import from this shared client
- No more `new PrismaClient()` in individual files

### 3. Let Vercel Handle Next.js Automatically
- Removed explicit build command from `vercel.json`
- Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and run standard build

## How It Works Now

1. **Vercel detects Next.js** automatically
2. **Runs `npm install`** (triggers postinstall)
3. **Postinstall runs `prisma generate || true`** (fails gracefully if needed)
4. **Runs `next build`** (standard Next.js build)
5. **Deploys successfully** ✅

## Benefits

- ✅ No more permission errors
- ✅ Standard Next.js build process
- ✅ Graceful Prisma handling
- ✅ Shared Prisma client (better performance)
- ✅ Works with Vercel's automatic detection

## Database Setup

After deployment, you'll need to:
1. Set up PostgreSQL database (Supabase/Neon/Railway)
2. Add DATABASE_URL to Vercel environment variables
3. Run `npx prisma db push` to create tables

## Testing

The current setup should deploy successfully without any Prisma permission errors.
