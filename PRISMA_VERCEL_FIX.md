# Prisma Configuration for Vercel

## The Issue
Vercel has permission issues with Prisma binaries during deployment. This is a common issue with serverless environments.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Prisma Client Generation in Build Script
The current setup uses `prisma generate && next build` in the build script, which should work.

### Option 2: Use Prisma Client Generation in postinstall
Added `postinstall: "prisma generate || true"` to handle cases where Prisma generation fails gracefully.

### Option 3: Alternative Prisma Setup
If issues persist, we can:
1. Pre-generate Prisma client
2. Use a different database approach
3. Use Vercel's built-in database solutions

## Current Configuration
- Build script: `prisma generate && next build`
- Postinstall: `prisma generate || true` (fails gracefully)
- Vercel build command: `npm run build`

## Testing
The current setup should work with Vercel's standard Next.js deployment process.
